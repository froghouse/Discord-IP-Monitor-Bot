# FUTURE_FEATURES.md

This document outlines potential improvements and new features that could be added to the Discord IP Monitor Bot.

## Architecture & Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Enhanced Discord Rate Limiting**: Implement proper Discord API rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Add circuit breaker for IP API calls when multiple services are down
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue monitoring with reduced functionality when some services fail
- **Message Queue**: Implement async message queuing for notifications during Discord API downtime

### Configuration & Flexibility
- **Database Support**: Replace JSON file storage with SQLite/PostgreSQL for better data integrity
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow runtime configuration changes via Discord commands
- **Custom IP APIs**: Allow users to configure their own IP detection services
- **Multi-Region Support**: Add support for checking IPs from different geographic regions

### Performance & Efficiency
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper HTTP connection pooling for IP service requests
- **Caching Layer**: Add intelligent caching to reduce API calls
- **Async Rate Limiter**: Replace threading-based rate limiter with async-native implementation
- **Memory Optimization**: Implement sliding window for IP history instead of loading full history

## New Features

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Geographic Location Tracking**: Show city/country information for IP changes
- **ISP Information**: Display ISP details and connection type changes
- **Multiple Notification Channels**: Support for webhooks, email, SMS notifications
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable alerts for frequent IP changes (potential connection issues)
- **Downtime Detection**: Monitor and alert when IP becomes unreachable
- **Speed Testing**: Periodic internet speed tests with change notifications

### User Experience
- **Slash Commands**: Migrate to Discord's modern slash command system
- **Interactive Embeds**: Rich embed messages with buttons for quick actions
- **Timezone Support**: User-configurable timezone for timestamps
- **Data Export**: Export IP history to CSV/JSON formats
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Show uptime, change frequency, and trends
- **Visual Charts**: Generate graphs of IP change patterns over time

### Security & Privacy
- **IP Masking**: Option to partially mask IP addresses in logs/notifications
- **Encryption**: Encrypt stored IP data and configuration files
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different bot commands
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all bot actions
- **VPN Detection**: Detect and flag when IP changes indicate VPN usage

### Advanced Monitoring
- **Port Scanning**: Check if specific ports are open after IP changes
- **Service Health Checks**: Monitor specific services/websites accessibility
- **DNS Monitoring**: Track DNS record changes for dynamic DNS setups
- **IPv6 Support**: Full dual-stack monitoring for IPv4 and IPv6
- **Custom Webhooks**: Send IP change notifications to external services
- **API Integration**: REST API for external systems to query IP status

## Technical Improvements

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for all components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with mock Discord API
- **Load Testing**: Performance testing for high-frequency IP changes
- **Mock Services**: Test framework with simulated IP APIs
- **Code Coverage**: Achieve >90% code coverage

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker Support**: Containerization with multi-arch builds
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Production-ready K8s deployment configs
- **Health Checks**: HTTP health endpoints for monitoring
- **Metrics Export**: Prometheus metrics for observability
- **Auto-Updates**: Self-updating capability with rollback support
- **Backup/Restore**: Automated backup of configuration and history data

### Documentation & Maintenance
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation if REST API is added
- **Migration Scripts**: Database migration tools for schema changes
- **Configuration Validation**: Advanced validation with helpful error messages
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in profiling and performance monitoring
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: Monitor and alert on memory consumption

## Breaking Changes (Major Version)

### Architecture Redesign
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom monitoring modules
- **Multi-Bot Support**: Single codebase supporting multiple Discord bots
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Migrate to event-based system with pub/sub
- **Microservices**: Split into separate services (monitoring, notifications, storage)

### Configuration Overhaul
- **YAML Configuration**: Move from .env to structured YAML configuration
- **Configuration Profiles**: Support for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- **Hot Reloading**: Reload configuration without restarting the bot

## Low Priority / Nice-to-Have

### Fun Features
- **IP History Visualization**: Web dashboard with interactive charts
- **IP Change Predictions**: ML-based prediction of likely IP change times
- **Location History Map**: Visual map of IP geographic changes
- **Uptime Badges**: Generate status badges for external websites

### Integration Features
- **Home Assistant**: Integration with home automation systems
- **IFTTT/Zapier**: Webhook integration with automation platforms
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Pre-built dashboards for monitoring
- **Slack/Teams**: Support for other chat platforms

### Experimental
- **IPv6 Transition Monitoring**: Track IPv4 to IPv6 migration
- **BGP Route Monitoring**: Monitor BGP route changes (advanced users)
- **Network Topology Mapping**: Map network path changes with traceroute

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Error handling improvements, database support, slash commands
2. **Medium Priority**: Geographic tracking, multiple notifications, security features
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced monitoring, experimental features, fun additions

Each feature should include proper error handling, logging, configuration options, and documentation.
