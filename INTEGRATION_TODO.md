## **Detailed Test Failure Analysis**

### **Specific Failure Patterns**

#### **Performance Test Failures**
- **Issue**: `test_concurrent_ip_checks_performance` succeeds only 5/50 operations
- **Root Cause**: Race conditions in async task management and improper exception handling
- **Location**: `tests/integration/test_performance.py`

#### **Database Connection Leaks**
- **Issue**: SQLite connections not properly closed in fixtures
- **Root Cause**: Missing `finally` blocks and improper fixture teardown
- **Location**: `tests/conftest.py`, storage-related tests

#### **HTTP Server Mock Issues**
- **Issue**: Mock servers not properly shutting down, causing port conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Async context managers not properly awaited
- **Location**: `tests/utils/http_server_mocks.py`

#### **Event Loop Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Custom event loop fixture conflicts with pytest-asyncio
- **Root Cause**: Deprecated event loop fixture redefinition
- **Location**: `tests/integration/conftest.py:35`

### **Test Configuration Issues**

#### **Pytest Configuration Problems**
- **Coverage Requirements**: 85% coverage requirement blocks test execution
- **Parallel Execution**: `pytest-xdist` causing coordination issues
- **Conflicting Settings**: Multiple configuration sources conflicting

#### **Fixture Management**
- **Scope Issues**: Session-scoped fixtures interfering with function-scoped tests
- **Cleanup Problems**: Fixtures not properly cleaning up resources
- **Dependency Chains**: Complex fixture dependencies causing initialization failures

### **Systematic Issues**

#### **Resource Management**
1. **Database connections** not using proper context managers
2. **HTTP client sessions** not properly closed
3. **Async tasks** not properly cancelled on test completion
4. **File handles** (temp files, config files) not cleaned up

#### **Test Isolation**
1. **Shared state** between tests causing interference
2. **Global singletons** not properly reset between tests
3. **Cache persistence** affecting subsequent tests
4. **Mock state** not properly reset

#### **Timing and Synchronization**
1. **Async operations** completing at unpredictable times
2. **Server startup/shutdown** timing issues
3. **Rate limiting** effects bleeding between tests
4. **Circuit breaker state** not properly reset

## **Immediate Action Items**

1. **Database Connection Fix**: Add proper `try/finally` blocks and context managers
2. **Event Loop Update**: Remove custom event loop fixture and use standard pytest-asyncio
3. **HTTP Server Cleanup**: Implement proper async teardown in mock servers
4. **Test Configuration**: Temporarily disable coverage requirements and parallel execution for debugging

This systematic approach addresses the root causes of integration test failures while building towards a more stable and maintainable test suite.
